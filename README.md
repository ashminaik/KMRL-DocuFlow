# KMRL DocuMind  

## Overview  
KMRL DocuMind is a demonstration project that addresses the challenge of document overload at Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL).  
Since 2017, KMRL has managed thousands of documents every day—engineering drawings, maintenance logs, HR policies, invoices, regulatory directives, and more. These arrive through emails, PDFs, scans, SharePoint, WhatsApp, and other channels, often in both English and Malayalam.  

The diversity and volume of documents make it difficult for teams to quickly find and act on the information that matters.

## Objective  
This project demonstrates how an AI-powered Document Intelligence System can:  

- Ingest documents from multiple sources  
- Summarize and highlight key insights  
- Support bilingual content (English and Malayalam)  
- Provide cross-department dashboards and awareness  
- Maintain traceability back to original sources  

The goal is to save time, improve compliance, reduce duplication of effort, and safeguard institutional knowledge.

## Tech Stack  
- Frontend: React / Next.js  
- Backend: Node.js / Express  
- AI & NLP: Python (Transformers, OCR, summarization)  
- LLM: OpenRouter (used for multilingual understanding, including Malayalam, as required in the SIH problem statement)  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Deployment: Vercel / Docker

## Features in this Demo  
- Upload and parse multi-format documents
- tagging documents into different departments
